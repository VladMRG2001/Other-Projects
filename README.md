# Other Projects
This folder contains other projects that I made during college

## LTspice Project

The goal of this project is to design an adaptation circuit between a sensor with a voltage output and a measurement instrument with a voltage input.
The two elements have significantly different nominal voltage input/output ranges, which means directly connecting them would result in unacceptable precision loss. Therefore, an amplifier is necessary to linearly transfer the sensor's output range into the measurement instrumentâ€™s input range.
For running the project you need LTspice XVII. Open the "Draft1.asc" file.

## Codesys Elevator

This project simulates the behavior of an elevator in a building. The application is written using Codesys application.
For running the project you need Codesys. Open the "Lift_Precis.project" file.

## RobotStudio Project

This project deals with simulating the behavior of an industrial robot that meets certain requirements, using the RAPID language in the RobotStudio application. The files are saved with the extension .rspag (Robot Studio Pack and Go).
For running the project you need RobotStudio. Open the "RobotStudioProject.rspag" file.
